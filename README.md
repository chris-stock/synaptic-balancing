This repository contains code related to the paper "Synaptic Balancing" by Chris Stock, Sarah Harvey, and Sam Ocko ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08530) 2021, in press at _PLoS Comp Bio_).

The code in this repo trains recurrent networks on simple tasks by gradient-based backprop. Code to balance networks according to the synaptic balancing dynamics introduced in the paper may be found in the `rnnops` package, located at https://github.com/chris-stock/rnnops.
